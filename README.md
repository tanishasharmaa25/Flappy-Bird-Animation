# Flappy-Bird-Animation
This project is a simple Flappy Bird–style animation developed in C using the Cairo graphics library.
It demonstrates the fundamentals of game logic, collision detection, rendering, animation frames, and user input handling. The project is ideal for learning how 2D graphics and animation work in C.
## FEAUTURES:
- Smooth bird Animation
- Randomly generated pipes(Obstacles)
- Frame by Frame rendering using Cairo
- Png Frame export
## CONCEPT LEARNED:
- Working with `cairo.h` for 2D rendering  
- Structs to manage game objects (`Bird`, `Obstacle`)  
- Random obstacle generation  
- Collision logic  
- Frame looping & animation timing  
- Handling user input  
- Exporting frames and generating animations  
- Using FFmpeg to convert PNG frames to video
## FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS:
- Add sprites for bird and pipes  
- Sound effects  
- Scoring UI  
- Smooth physics  
- Menu screen
